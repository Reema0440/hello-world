In web design, I like to develop the skills necessary to create website that
are both visually appealing and user-friendly. My goal is to learn how to design responsive 
websites that look great on any device, from desktop computers to smartphones. I also want
to focus on making websites accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. 
Additionally, I aim to master the use of modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and
JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Ultimately, I want to build a
strong portfolio of web design projects that demonstrate my ability to create functional 
and aesthetical  websites that meet the needs of users and businesses.
